This error can be a result of several factors, one being that it is too short to properly benefit from the likelihood of words, making the prediction too much based upon the prior probability, which is biased towards the class \"negative\" because the amount of negative tweets in the training set is significantly larger than the other classes. In addition, the smiley face is ignored, which for humans is usually a sign of positivity.\n",
